This directory contains examples of agent startup scripts for z/OS.
The scripts are provided by Teradata (http://www.teradata.com/).

These scripts should be placed into the agent installation directory (not
under "bin" folder, because its content is removed during agent upgrade).

The scripts are exemplary and thus may require additional tuning to work in
specific environment.

* start.sh - this script must be used to start agent, instead of default agent.sh script
* restart.sh - this script is used to restart agent after the upgrade

Note that initially, before starting the agent, scripts in the "bin" directory
must be converted to IBM-1047 encoding.
                       
Both scripts set _BPX_SHAREAS environment variable to NO. This is
required for the agent upgrade procedure to work properly.

Also scripts set TEAMCITY_AGENT_START_CMD environment variable. This is
required, because under z/OS agent default shell scripts must be in
IBM-1047 encoding. The command specified in TEAMCITY_AGENT_START_CMD
variable will be invoked right after the upgrade of the agent files. The
purpose of this command is to prepare shell scripts and start the agent.
